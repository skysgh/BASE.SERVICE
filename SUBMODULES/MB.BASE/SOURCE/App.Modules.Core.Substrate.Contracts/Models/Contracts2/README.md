## Description ##

Folder of contracts that are not specific to Entities
but then again have wider use than just Services.

## Development Notes ##

The following contracts are about lifespans, and are
almost always -- *but not always* -- interfaces that
Service contracts inherit from.

Note that the use of contracts makes reflection easier
than searching for Attributes.
